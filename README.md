# 💳 Credit Risk Analysis & Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Financial institutions must evaluate whether a customer is likely to repay a loan before approving credit.  
This project builds a **Machine Learning classification model** to predict **credit risk (Good / Bad)** using the German Credit dataset.

The goal is to reduce financial losses by identifying high-risk customers early.
